=begin
Ruby supports a rich set of operators, as you'd expect from a modern language. 
Most operators are actually method calls. For example, a + b is interpreted as a.+(b), where the + method in the object
 referred to by variable a is called with b as its argument.

For each operator (+ - * / % ** & | ^ << >> && ||), 
there is a corresponding form of abbreviated assignment operator (+= -= etc.)
